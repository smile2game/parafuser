# 🚀Parallel Inference and traing Diffusion model

This repository serves as a review of parallel inference and training for diffusion models (both UNet and Transformer backbones), using my custom methods alongside other open-source repositories.

I have tested all open-source methods for parallel inference and training of diffusion models, listed them below, and conducted comparative experiments in the experiments section to evaluate their performance.

Additionally, based on these foundations, I developed my own parallelization solutions and extended support for more models.
